This project, developed over the summer, focuses on an AI-powered medical diagnostic system. It leverages a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents, including a Cardiologist, Psychologist, and Pulmonologist, independently analyze patient medical reports. Their individual findings are then synthesized by a Multidisciplinary Team agent to provide a comprehensive health summary, identify specific concerns, and propose a concise, personalized treatment plan. The system is built using Python, Langchain, and OpenAI models, and features a Streamlit application for user interaction, enabling seamless report analysis and the option to email the final diagnosis. The core work involved designing and implementing these agents and their collaborative workflow to enhance medical assessment capabilities.
